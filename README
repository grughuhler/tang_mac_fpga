This directory contains C and verilog source files for the "mac_fpga"
project for the Tang Nano 9K FPGA.

There are videos about this on YouTube:

There are two versions, one that uses two unidirectional signals
between the Raspberry Pi and the FPGA and one that uses a single
bidirectional signal.  Be careful not to get them mixed up.

The verilog for the sipo and pipo shift registers is the same for
both.
