These programs use the pigpio library so

   sudo apt install libpigpio-dev

Then, just "make" to build on the Raspberry Pi.  Take a look at the
Makefile.  It builds two versions of the program: mac_command1 uses a
single birectional signal while mac_command uses two unidirectional
signals.  The two use slightly different pins, so pay attention to
that.

Run as root, e.g. sudo ./mac_command.

Type "help" to see a list of commands.

Tested on Raspbian 10.  Program mac_command is the original that uses
separate signal wires for send and receive.  Program mac_command1 is
updated to use a single bidirectional signal.

Be careful that the Raspberry Pi and the FPGA are not confgured as
outputs at the same time.  That could damage hardware.

For mac_command1, I tested with the iop signal connected between the
Raspberry Pi and the Tang Nano 9K via a 1k resistor.  This works and
may provide protection when both are outputs due to error.  But,
still, avoid this.
